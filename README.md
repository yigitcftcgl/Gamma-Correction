# Gamma-Correction
This project demonstrates the application of gamma correction in grayscale image processing. It involves analyzing the histograms and visual properties of an image under different transformations (brightness and darkness adjustments).

# Comments
The histogram of the original image was observed to be concentrated between 100-200 pixel intensities. This suggested that the original image had a generally good balance of brightness and contrast.
In the bright image, it was noticed that the pixel intensities shifted to the right in the histogram. This shift suggested that the brightness enhancement process was successfully applied.
In the dark image, it was observed that the pixel intensities shifted to the left and the histogram was concentrated at low values. This indicated that the darkening process was applied correctly.
After the gamma correction, it was noticed that the histograms of both images approached the original image. This suggested that the gamma correction was applied effectively.
The fact that the PSNR values ​​were quite high, such as 45.15 dB (bright) and 46.92 dB (dark), proved that the images were almost completely approximated to the original with the gamma correction.
